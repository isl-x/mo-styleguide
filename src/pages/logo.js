    <Section title="The Logo">
      <Basic>
        The Capital One Ventures logo mark stands out as the center of our
        graphic design system and is our principle brand identifier. It makes a
        fresh statement about the precise and modern style of Capital One
        Ventures and speaks to the brandâ€™s confidence, future-facing, and
        approachable mindset.

    <Section title="Logo Color Variations">
      <Basic>
        While the preferred logo treatment is the full-color logo on white, the
        full-color logo can also appear on light blue backgrounds, provided
        there is enough contrast. The white text logo should appear over Core
        Blue 60. The one-color white logo should be used on photographic
        backgrounds with enough contrast. The one-color blue logo is reserved
        color-limited applications. Carefully consider before using this
        variation.

        of the logo mark, no matter how small, compromises the credibility of
        the brand. These examples demonstrate a few of the many non-compliant
        logo reproductions.
