A base project for all of your styleguide needs!
Intended to be able to be used by the not so technical and technical to quickly get a styleguide site up.

## Requirements
Wiki: [First Time Setup](https://github.com/istrategylabs/mo-styleguide/wiki/First-Time-Setup)

## Development
Wiki: [Setup your repo and run](https://github.com/istrategylabs/mo-styleguide/wiki/Start-New-Style-Guide#set-up-and-run)

## Usage
Wiki: [Lay of the land](https://github.com/istrategylabs/mo-styleguide/wiki/Start-New-Style-Guide#lay-of-the-land)

#### Making a new page
Super simple. Follow this easy three step process:

1. Find the page template you want in src/page_templates
2. Copy it into pages
3. Edit and remove blocks as desired! We recommend you stick within the framework of the example blocks if you are very
new to programming (i.e. do a lot of copy pasting), but technically you can get really custom with anything and everything.

## Troubleshooting
- All assets in the asset folder need to be named unique names. Even those files in sub-folders need to be unique.
